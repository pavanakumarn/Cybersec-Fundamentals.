# <u>Introduction</u>

## <u> Fundamental Security Concepts </u>
The whole principle is to avoid **Theft, Tampering and Disruption** of the systems through **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).

- **Confidentiality**
Keeping systems and data from being accessed, seen, read to anyone who is not authorized to do so.
Information is accessible only to the autorized personnel.

- **Integrity**
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF DATA OR RESOUCES: Protect the data from modification or deletion by unauthorized parties, and ensuring that when authorized people make changes that shouldn't have been made the damage can be undone.

- **Availability**
ACCESSIBLE WHEN REQUIRED BY AUTHORIZED USERS: Systems, access channels, and authentication mechanisms must all be working properly for the information they provide and protect to be available when needed.

- **Authenticity**
Refers to the characterstic of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the quality of being geniune.
	
**Note:** *In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved. (ISO/IEC 27000:2009)*

- **Auditing & Accountability**
Basically keep tracking of everthing, like, who's been logging in when are they loggin in whose access this data.

- **Non-Repudiation**
Non-repudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. Non-repudiation is a legal concept that is widely used in information security and refers to a service, which provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data.

### **Security, Functionality and Usability balance**

There is an inter dependency between these three attributes. When **security goes up, usability and functionality come down**. Any organization should balance between these three qualities to arrive at a balanced information system.
