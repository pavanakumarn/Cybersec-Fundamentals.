## What is a cybersecurity threat?

A cybersecurity threat refers to any potential danger or risk that has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or IT systems. These threats are posed by malicious actors who attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, or cause harm to individuals, organizations, or even entire nations. Cybersecurity threats can take various forms and target different aspects of digital systems and data.

## Why do malicious actors want to compromise data and IT systems?

Malicious actors compromise data and IT systems for a variety of reasons, often driven by personal gain, ideological motives, or the desire to cause disruption. Understanding these motivations can help organizations and individuals better defend against cyber threats. 

## What are the most common types of cybersecurity threats?

There are several common types of cybersecurity attacks that malicious actors use to compromise systems, steal data, and cause disruptions. Here are some of the most prevalent types at the time of writing

1. **Phishing**:

Phishing involves sending deceptive emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources in order to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. Phishing can also lead victims to malicious websites or to download malware.

2. **Malware**:

Malware (malicious software) encompasses a range of malicious programs designed to infect systems, steal data, or cause damage. Types of malware include:

- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.

- **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software, they give attackers unauthorized access.

- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that attach to files and spread.

- **Worms**: Self-replicating programs that spread through networks.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:

DoS attacks overload a target system, rendering it unavailable to users. DDoS attacks involve using a network of compromised devices to flood a target with traffic, making it difficult for the system to function properly or they may stop the system working entirely.

4. **SQL Injection**:

In this attack, attackers manipulate a web application's input fields to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to databases and sensitive data.

5. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

Attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications, which are then executed by unsuspecting users' browsers. This can lead to the theft of user data and/or the spreading of malware.

6. **Social Engineering**:

Social engineering exploits human psychology to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

7. **Zero-Day (0day) Exploits**:

These attacks target vulnerabilities in software or hardware that are not yet known to the vendor or public. Attackers take advantage of these vulnerabilities before patches are developed. Many organizations worry about zero-days as there is no patch for them but they are not as common as the other attacks on this list. When a zero-day is discovered, security researchers will work quickly to make a patch and hence zero-days are generally short lived.

8. **Credential Attacks**:

These attacks include brute force attacks, where attackers repeatedly guess passwords, and credential stuffing attacks, where stolen credentials from one site are used to attempt access on other sites**.**
