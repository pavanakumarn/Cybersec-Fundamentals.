## What is a cybersecurity threat?

A cybersecurity threat refers to any potential danger or risk that has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or IT systems. These threats are posed by malicious actors who attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, or cause harm to individuals, organizations, or even entire nations. Cybersecurity threats can take various forms and target different aspects of digital systems and data.

## Why do malicious actors want to compromise data and IT systems?

Malicious actors compromise data and IT systems for a variety of reasons, often driven by personal gain, ideological motives, or the desire to cause disruption. Understanding these motivations can help organizations and individuals better defend against cyber threats. 

## What are the most common types of cybersecurity threats?

There are several common types of cybersecurity attacks that malicious actors use to compromise systems, steal data, and cause disruptions. Here are some of the most prevalent types at the time of writing

1. **Phishing**:

Phishing involves sending deceptive emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources in order to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. Phishing can also lead victims to malicious websites or to download malware.

2. **Malware**:

Malware (malicious software) encompasses a range of malicious programs designed to infect systems, steal data, or cause damage. Types of malware include:

- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.

- **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software, they give attackers unauthorized access.

- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that attach to files and spread.

- **Worms**: Self-replicating programs that spread through networks.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:

DoS attacks overload a target system, rendering it unavailable to users. DDoS attacks involve using a network of compromised devices to flood a target with traffic, making it difficult for the system to function properly or they may stop the system working entirely.
